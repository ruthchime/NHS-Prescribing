# NHS Antidepressant Prescribing Trends (2021–2023)

This project presents a data-driven analysis of antidepressant prescribing trends across England, focusing on volume, cost, regional disparities, and drug-level efficiency. It was conducted as part of my MSc module **DAT7304 – Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To help the NHS identify inefficiencies in antidepressant prescribing, reduce spending, and maintain high-quality mental health care using real NHS data.

## 💡 Additional Insights & Recommendations

The goal of this project is not just to understand trends, but to support the NHS in making **data-driven, cost-effective prescribing decisions**:

- ✅ **Prioritise low-cost, effective drugs** like *Sertraline* and *Citalopram* to reduce spending without compromising care.
- 📉 **Phase out high-cost, low-volume drugs** where cheaper alternatives offer equal efficacy (e.g., *Venlafaxine*).
- 📍 **Standardise prescribing across NHS regions** to reduce inefficiencies and support equity.
- 🔍 **Monitor price-volatile drugs** like *Fluoxetine* to avoid budget shocks.
- 🧠 **Educate prescribers** with dashboards showing cost-effective options and real-time data.
- 📊 **Support national procurement strategies** to negotiate better drug pricing.
- 🧾 **Conduct periodic audits** to ensure clinical decisions align with financial targets.
