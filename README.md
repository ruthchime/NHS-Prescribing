## 💡 Additional Insights & Recommendations

The goal of this project is not just to understand trends, but to support the NHS in making **data-driven, cost-effective prescribing decisions**. Based on the analysis, here are key insights and suggestions:

- ✅ **Prioritise low-cost, effective drugs** like *Sertraline* and *Citalopram* to reduce overall spending without compromising care.

- 📉 **Phase out high-cost, low-volume drugs** where cheaper alternatives with similar efficacy exist (e.g., *Venlafaxine* vs *Sertraline*).

- 📍 **Standardise prescribing practices across regions** to avoid inefficiencies—some areas spend significantly more without prescribing significantly more.

- 🔍 **Monitor drugs with unstable pricing** like *Fluoxetine*, which showed cost spikes despite stable prescription volume.

- 🧠 **Educate prescribers using real-time data**, such as monthly cost-per-drug reports or dashboard alerts embedded in GP systems.

- 📊 **Support national procurement policies** that allow NHS England to negotiate better prices or stockpile essential drugs during low-cost periods.

- 🧾 **Conduct ongoing clinical audits** to align local prescribing patterns with national cost-effectiveness goals.
